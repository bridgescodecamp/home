## Life, we all need one at times. ##

This folder contains six files, with *life.html* being the root 
file. It will (should) launch a DOM implemented representation 
of the game of life from before. The animateworld.js file 
is unaltered from the assignment, aside from a single line 
that was printing to the console upon loading for debugging 
purposes. That line has been removed.
